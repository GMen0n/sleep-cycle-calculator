# 🛌 Sleep Cycle Calculator

A simple web tool that helps you calculate your **ideal wake-up time** based on your **bedtime** and how long it usually takes you to fall asleep. 
It uses the 90-minute circadian rhythm theory to suggest wake-up times that leave you feeling refreshed.

## 🌙 What It Does

- Asks when you plan to go to sleep
- Lets you specify how long it typically takes you to fall asleep (buffer time)
- Calculates ideal wake-up times using 90-minute sleep cycles
- Presents results in an easy-to-read layout

## 🧠 How It Works

Your body naturally cycles through different stages of sleep every ~90 minutes. Waking up **between** cycles (rather than during deep sleep) leaves you feeling less groggy.

This tool assumes:
- A typical person completes ~5–6 cycles per night
- Each cycle = 90 minutes
- Sleep latency (time it takes to fall asleep) is added as a buffer
